Crazy colors
==========
Another useless project, but if you like unicorns, crazy colors & all that stuff you'll like it. It only works in webkit browsers as it relies on a little hack to do the timer effect but I hope to make it work in opera/firefox soon. 
Actually I'm not even sure it is revelant to try and make it work on those browsers regarding the uselessness of that script. But if someone comes accross and wants to give it a chance...

Technically it relies on CSS3 animation events, the HTML5 "range" input and the HSL way of declaring colors in css.
