Crazy colors
==========
Another useless project, but if you like unicorns, crazy colors & all that stuff you'll like it. It only works in webkit browsers as it relies on a little hack to do the timer effect but I hope to make it work in opera/firefox soon. 
Actually I'm not even sure it is revelant to try and make it work on those browsers regarding the uselessness of that script.
